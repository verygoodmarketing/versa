  intro:
    "Squarespace is known for gorgeous design — it's the go-to for photographers, boutique hotels, and design studios. But if you're a plumber, landscaper, cleaner, or electrician, you probably don't need a runway-worthy website. You need one that gets the phone ringing.\n\nHere's how GroundWork and Squarespace compare for local service businesses.",

GroundWork auto-generates local SEO markup, integrates with your Google Business Profile, and is built to help you rank in your service area from day one.",
