  intro:
    "If you're a plumber, cleaner, landscaper, or contractor shopping for a website builder, you've probably come across Wix. It's everywhere — TV ads, Google results, billboards. But Wix was built for everyone: bloggers, artists, e-commerce stores. That means it was not really built for you.\n\nGroundWork is. Here's how the two compare.",
