  intro:

GroundWork's templates are designed specifically for service trades — plumbers, cleaners, landscapers, electricians. That means the right page sections (services, service areas, certifications, contact), the right language, and the right conversion flow for a homeowner who needs help now.",

But to get email marketing, appointment scheduling, and priority support, the cost jumps — and you may still need third-party tools for review management, local SEO optimization, and lead tracking. GroundWork bundles everything a local service business needs at $39–$79/month. No surprises.",

But local SEO — ranking when someone searches \"plumber in [your city]\" — requires specific signals: local business schema, Google Business Profile sync, service area pages, and proper metadata. GroundWork auto-handles all of this. GoDaddy gives you settings to configure, and most business owners leave them at default.",

After you complete a job, you send a one-tap review request and your customer lands on your Google review page with one click. More reviews mean more trust, more calls, and better local rankings. It's one of the highest-ROI features available to local service businesses — and GroundWork includes it.",

They also offer 24/7 phone support, which some business owners prefer.\n\nIf you just need a basic presence and your primary concern is cost at any price point, GoDaddy's lowest tier is cheaper than GroundWork's. But for a local service business that wants actual growth — more leads, better rankings, more reviews — the comparison isn't close.",
