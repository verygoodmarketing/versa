        <p style="margin:0 0 16px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;color:#333333;">
          Quick question: when someone searches for a ${t.trade} in ${t.city} after 5pm on a Tuesday — does your business show up? And if they land on your site, can they request a quote without calling?
        </p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 16px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;color:#333333;">
          Most local service businesses can't answer yes to both. Those leads quietly go to the next result. You never knew they were there.
        </p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 16px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:26px;color:#333333;">
          That's the problem <a href="https://groundworklocal.com" style="color:#1a1a2e;">GroundWork</a> solves.

          If you're already getting all the leads you want, ignore this. But if you're leaving work on the table because people can't find you easily — it's worth 5 minutes to look.
