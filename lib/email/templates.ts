You signed up for Versa yesterday — nice. But your site isn't live yet.

It only takes a few minutes to get your business online. Here's where you left off:

Continue Setup → ${appUrl}/onboarding

Once your site is live, local customers can find you. Every day offline is a day a competitor gets that customer instead.

Three days ago you started building your Versa site.

You have 11 days left in your free trial — but your site still isn't live.

Getting online is the single highest-ROI thing you can do for your business this week. Customers search for you. If they don't find you, they find someone else.

You've had Versa for a week. Your site is live.

You're halfway through your 14-day trial. Here's what happens on day 14:

Free plan: Your site stays live with Versa branding. Lead capture, email marketing, and review requests are paused.

Pro plan (${planPrice}/mo): Everything stays on. No Versa branding. Leads keep coming in. Reviews keep getting collected. Your email list keeps growing.

Most of our customers upgrade because they don't want to lose the leads they've already captured.

Upgrade to Pro — ${planPrice}/mo → ${pricingUrl}

No pressure — but now you know what's at stake.

Don't lose what you've built.

- All leads captured so far
- Automated review requests
- Email marketing to your list
- Local SEO tools

You're in. Welcome to Versa Pro.

Your site is fully live, your leads are flowing, and your reviews are on autopilot.

Make the most of your plan this week:

1. Launch your first email campaign. You have a list — use it. Go to Email → New Campaign. Takes 10 minutes.

2. Check your leads dashboard. See who's contacted you through your site. Follow up fast — leads go cold quick.

3. Verify your Google Business Profile. This is the single biggest thing you can do for local search visibility. Go to SEO → Google Profile.

Go to My Dashboard → ${appUrl}/dashboard

Thank you for trusting Versa with your business.
